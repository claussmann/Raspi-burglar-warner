# Raspi burglar warner

...is a tool, that lets you convert a RaspberryPi into a surveillance camera, 
which can send pictures of the burgler via Telegram on your phone.

You can also control the camera via Telegram from anywhere on Earth (... if you have Internet respectively).

## What do i need?

. RaspberryPi (Model >= 2)
. Camera (best would be the official Pi-Camera or PiNoIr, otherwise you will need to configure it by yourself)
. Telegram account WITH username
. SD-Card with Rasbian (Desktop is not necessary)

## Install
. Create your telegram bot (see section 'Create telegram bot')
. Connect the camera to your pi.
. Best is to have a fresh rasbian install on the sd-card.
. Run the Raspi-config and do your normal config (expand filesystem, change passwords, wifi,...).
. Run the Raspi-config and enable the Camera interface.
. Copy this repository to your pi or clone it with git on your pi.
. run 

  sudo make install
  
. For your specific setup, you might need to ajust the 
  
  /etc/burglar_warner/motion/motion.conf 
  
. Reboot your pi.
. Write a telegram message (e.g. /status) to your telegram bot.
. If you get response(may take about 10s), everything works fine. Otherwise see syslog for information.

## Create telegram bot

See https://core.telegram.org/bots

. Open a chat with the BotFather
. create a new bot using 
  
  /newbot
  
. follow the instructions of BotFather
. You will get a *Token* which you will need later!
. I recommend to use /setcommands to tell BotFather which comands are supported

  /setcommands
  <choose botname>
  @botname
  <enter commands>
  start - start motion detection
  stop - stop motion detection
  status - see if bot is reachable
  reboot - reboots the system
  poweroff - shuts down the system
  now - take a picture now and send it
  subscribe - get notifications when motion is detected
  unsubscribe - no longer get notifications
  
. Start a chat with your bot (recommanded BEFORE you install it on the pi)

## Troubleshooting

[quanda]
I didn't get any response from my bot after install::
  If your bot started but didn't find any messages yet, it may turn to fail-state (bug...). 
  Try sending a few times `+/status+` and restart the pi.

This tool uses the well known program "motion" (github.com/Motion-Project/motion). Special thanks to the developers! +
In Addition this tool would be impossible without the Telegram Bot API! Thank you Telegram!
