# Raspi burglar warner

...is a tool, that lets you convert a RaspberryPi into a surveillance camera, 
which can send pictures of the burgler via Telegram on your phone.

You can also control the camera via Telegram from anywhere on Earth (... if you have Internet respectively).

## Install
. Create your telegram bot (see section 'Create telegram bot')
. Connect your camera to your pi.
. Best is to have a fresh rasbian install on the sd-card.
. Run the Raspi-config and do your normal config (expand filesystem, change passwords, wifi,...).
. Run the Raspi-config and enable the Camera interface.
. Copy this repository to your pi or clone it with git on your pi.
. run 

  sudo make install
  
You might need to ajust the 
  
  /etc/burglar_warner/motion/motion.conf 
  
for your setup. +
The Telegram bot will only start motion with this config file, so you are free to use motion with other config files in other contexts.
